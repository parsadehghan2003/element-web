# Start9 fork of Element Web

Start9's fork of [element-hq/element-web](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web): the web client at
`support.start9.me`, shipped as `ghcr.io/start9labs/element-web` and deployed by `ansible-matrix-support`.
Upstream's own docs still apply — [README.md](README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md),
[developer_guide.md](developer_guide.md), `docs/`. This file covers only what is different here.

`start9.me` runs with end-to-end encryption disabled and its users keyless, so the client has to work well
with encryption off, on a phone, and installed as a PWA. Upstream is built for the opposite: it nags to set
up encryption, sends phone browsers to the native apps, and lays out for the desktop.

## Branches

- `master` is the fork: an upstream release tag with our patches on top. Work lands through a pull request
  against it now that production runs a tag cut from it; nothing deploys `master` itself.
- `e2ee` is `master` without keyless mode, for a homeserver that keeps end-to-end encryption on: the phone, PWA and
  push patches over upstream's own handling of encryption, with the keyless files listed under Patches at upstream's
  version. Everything lands on `master` first and is merged down — `git merge master` on `e2ee`, pushed directly;
  never merge `e2ee` into `master`. A conflict in a keyless file resolves to upstream's file at the base tag
  (`git checkout v1.12.28 -- <file>`), and `git diff v1.12.28 -- <those files>` must come back empty afterwards but
  for the web push line in `MatrixClientPeg.ts`.
- Upstream is merged, never rebased, so history stays shared and each release lands as one merge. Merge
  release tags only, never `develop`.
- `upstream` remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/element-hq/element-web.git`.
- `gh` sees a fork and aims pull requests at element-hq by default; `gh repo set-default Start9Labs/element-web` once
  per clone, or pass `--repo Start9Labs/element-web`.

## Taking an upstream release

```bash
git fetch upstream --tags
git merge -Xignore-space-change v1.12.28   # on master
pnpm lint:fmt:fix                          # re-indent the blocks a patch wraps
# resolve what is left, run the checks below
git push origin master v1.12.28            # the image build reads its version from the nearest tag
git switch e2ee && git merge master        # keyless files back to upstream's, the checks again, push
```

`-Xignore-space-change` lets upstream's edits win inside a block a patch only re-indented; the formatter puts the
indentation back. Upstream's workflows are disabled in the repo's Actions settings rather than deleted, so
`.github/workflows/` never conflicts. After a merge, disable anything a release added:

```bash
gh workflow list --all   # everything except "Start9" should read `disabled_manually`
gh workflow disable <name>
```

## Releasing

Tag `master` as `v<upstream>-start9.<n>`, for example `v1.12.27-start9.1`, and `e2ee` as `v<upstream>-start9-e2ee.<n>`.
The `Start9` workflow publishes `ghcr.io/start9labs/element-web:<tag>` for amd64 and arm64 once the test jobs pass,
plus `:latest` for a `master` tag; a push to `master` or `e2ee` publishes `:<branch>` and `:sha-<short>` without
waiting for them. Production deploys by pointing `matrix_client_element_container_image` in `ansible-matrix-support`
at a tag.

## Checks

CI runs upstream's full jest and vitest suites, so an upstream merge that breaks a patch fails there. Locally, run
the files you touched:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec nx run element-web:test:unit:prepare
cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run src/hooks src/utils/crypto   # vitest: src/**/*.test.ts*
cd apps/web && pnpm exec jest test/unit-tests/components/views/settings/devices   # jest: test/unit-tests/**/*-test.ts*
```

`lint:types` is red at upstream's own release tags at the moment (matrix-js-sdk under TypeScript 7), so check it
with `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -v MSC4108SignInWithQR` in `apps/web` until that clears.

Build the image from the repo root with `docker buildx bake element-web`. It reads `.git` for the version, so
build from a clone, not an export.

## Patches

Keyless mode is one decision: when the homeserver's `.well-known/matrix/client` sets `io.element.e2ee.force_disable`,
the client never initialises crypto (`fetchShouldForceDisableEncryption`, called once from `MatrixClientPeg.assign`).
Everything else follows from `client.getCrypto()` being undefined, a state upstream already tolerates for its
low-bandwidth mode; each component that still rendered encryption UI in that state guards itself.

The bar for what to remove: nothing may mention encryption at all. The user is not told encryption is off, and
nothing may look like an error or push them to enable encryption, verify a session, or set up backup or recovery.
Upstream's informational hints go too: the composer's open padlock and "unencrypted" placeholder, the "Not encrypted"
badge, the encryption toggles, and settings that only apply to encrypted rooms.

Rules for a patch, so that upstream merges stay cheap:

- New logic goes in a new file. An upstream file gets an import and a one-line guard, in the component that renders
  the UI. Never plumb a prop through intermediate components.
- Gate on `client.getCrypto()` (`useCryptoDisabled()` in function components), not on Start9 or on the well-known.
  Keyed homeservers keep upstream's behaviour, and the guard doubles as a fix for low-bandwidth mode, which is what
  makes it worth sending upstream.
- Prefer adding a line after upstream's block to editing lines inside it. When a wrapper is unavoidable, accept the
  re-indent; the merge procedure above absorbs it.
- Tests: fork behaviour in a new test file where the setup is small, otherwise one
  `describe("when crypto is disabled")` in upstream's test that restores any shared mock afterwards. Where an
  upstream test pins the exact state a patch changes, update its snapshot rather than bending the test; on a merge
  that conflicts in a `.snap`, take upstream's file, rerun the suite with `-u`, and check the diff shows only fork
  behaviour.
- Add every upstream file touched to the list below; a reader diffing against the base tag uses it to tell ours from
  theirs.

Upstream files carrying a keyless patch, on `master` only (under `apps/web/src/`):

- `MatrixClientPeg.ts` — skip crypto initialisation, the only place the well-known (or `force_disable_encryption` in
  config, read in `utils/crypto/fetchShouldForceDisableEncryption.ts`) decides anything.
- `components/views/rooms/MessageComposer.tsx` — no open padlock, and "Send a message…" rather than "Send an
  unencrypted message…" (`keylessComposerPlaceholder.ts`).
- `components/views/right_panel/RoomSummaryCardView.tsx` — no "Not encrypted" badge.
- `components/views/dialogs/CreateRoomDialog.tsx` — no encryption toggles.
- `components/views/settings/tabs/room/{SecurityRoomSettingsTab,RolesRoomSettingsTab,VoipRoomSettingsTab}.tsx` — no
  encryption toggle, no "enable encryption" power level, no "end-to-end encrypted" call caption.
- `components/views/settings/tabs/user/{PreferencesUserSettingsTab,SessionManagerTab}.tsx` and
  `components/views/settings/devices/DeviceMetaData.tsx` — no "previews in encrypted rooms" toggle, no "verify your
  sessions" advice, no Verified/Unverified on sessions.
- `components/views/settings/Notifications.tsx` — no rules for encrypted messages.
- `verification.ts` — pending-verification lookup tolerates missing crypto.
- `device-listener/DeviceListenerCurrentDevice.ts` — no setup-encryption toast when the homeserver force-disables
  encryption and no room is encrypted; covers a session that started while the well-known was unreachable.
- `components/views/dialogs/UserSettingsDialog.tsx` — no Encryption tab.
- `components/views/settings/tabs/user/SecurityUserSettingsTab.tsx` — no encryption section, no "encryption
  disabled by your admin" warning.
- `components/views/settings/tabs/user/HelpUserSettingsTab.tsx` — no crypto version line.
- `components/views/settings/devices/{DeviceTypeIcon,DeviceVerificationStatusCard,SecurityRecommendations,LoginWithQRSection,FilteredDeviceList}.tsx`
  — a Sessions tab without verification badges, cards, recommendations, filters, or QR sign-in.
- `components/views/rooms/NewRoomIntro.tsx` — no "encryption isn't enabled" warning in a new DM; upstream already
  hides it once the well-known is known, this covers the first render after login.
- `viewmodels/menus/UserMenuViewModel.ts` — no "Link new device" in the user menu without crypto.

Upstream files carrying a patch on both branches (under `apps/web/src/` unless noted):

- `MatrixClientPeg.ts` — start web push once the client runs.
- `components/structures/TabbedView.tsx` — on a phone, the tabs are a list and a tab opens as its own page with a back
  button (`PhoneTabs.tsx`, styled in `res/css/start9/mobile.pcss`).
- `components/views/dialogs/UserSettingsDialog.tsx` — on a phone the title is just "Settings"; the tab's page names
  itself.
- `packages/shared-types/lib/config.json.d.ts` (repository root) — `force_disable_encryption`.
- `components/views/rooms/RoomHeader/RoomHeader.tsx` — mounts `BackToRoomListButton`; no call buttons on phones, so
  the room name keeps its width.
- `vector/index.ts` — imports the mobile stylesheet; no redirect of phone browsers to the native-app page; a chunk
  that fails to load during start-up is reported as a stale page rather than an unexpected error.
- `SdkConfig.ts` — no app-store links by default, so the unsupported-browser page offers none.
- `webpack.config.ts` — the native-app guide page is not built.
- `res/manifest.json` (under `apps/web/`) — no related native applications.
- `components/views/auth/AuthFooter.tsx` — `branding.auth_footer_powered_by_matrix: false` drops the Matrix link.
- `components/views/auth/PasswordLogin.tsx` and `RegistrationForm.tsx` — `disable_phone_login`; the registration
  form only promises discovery by email when `UIFeature.identityServer` is on.
- `vector/init.tsx` — applies `web_app_manifest` once the config is loaded, starts the visual-viewport fit, and watches
  for a stale page.
- `SupportedBrowser.ts` — phones are a supported device type, Samsung Internet is a supported browser, and
  "Mobile Safari" is judged as Safari, so a current phone browser gets no "unsupported browser" toast.
- `serviceworker/index.ts` — imports the push handlers.
- `BasePlatform.ts` — the client's own notifications carry the room id as their tag, so one from the service worker
  for the same room replaces it instead of doubling up.
- `vector/index.html` — the content security policy admits the generated manifest (`manifest-src blob:`); the
  viewport meta asks for `viewport-fit=cover` and `interactive-widget=resizes-content`.
- `packages/shared-types/lib/config.json.d.ts` — types for the keys above.
- `i18n/strings/en_EN.json` — the fork's strings live under one `start9` key.
- `docker/nginx-templates/default.conf.template` (under `apps/web/`) — `sw.js` and `manifest.json` are served
  `no-cache` like `index.html`, so a deploy replaces the service worker on the next launch rather than within a day.
- `.github/workflows/start9.yaml` — the only workflow that runs here.

Deployment-specific behaviour is configuration, never code: a key with upstream's behaviour as its default, documented
in `docs/fork.md`.

Fork-only files: `utils/crypto/fetchShouldForceDisableEncryption.ts` and `hooks/useCryptoDisabled.ts` on `master`
only; `hooks/usePhoneLayout.ts`, `components/views/rooms/RoomHeader/BackToRoomListButton.tsx`,
`res/css/start9/mobile.pcss`, `vector/webAppManifest.ts`, `vector/phoneViewport.ts`, `vector/stalePage.tsx`,
`serviceworker/push.ts`, `utils/push/webPush.ts`, `utils/push/protocol.ts` on both; and their tests.

## Mobile layout

Phones (`max-width: 767px`) show one pane at a time. `res/css/start9/mobile.pcss` does the layout on its own: it
reads navigation state off the DOM with `:has()` (a `.mx_RoomView` means a room is open, a `.mx_RightPanel` means a
card covers it), so `LoggedInView`, `RoomView` and the right panel are untouched. `vector/index.ts` imports it, which
keeps it outside the `app-web` cascade layer every theme stylesheet lives in; an unlayered rule beats a layered one
whatever the specificity, so the file never fights upstream's selectors. `!important` is reserved for the pane
group's inline sizes. The only React is `BackToRoomListButton` in the room header, which shows the home page with
`context_switch` set so the active space survives, and `usePhoneLayout()`, which shares the breakpoint.

The keyboard is handled twice over: `interactive-widget=resizes-content` in the viewport meta makes Chromium shrink
the layout viewport, and `vector/phoneViewport.ts` does the same by hand for WebKit, which only shrinks the visual
viewport, by sizing the root to it while it is smaller than the window. `viewport-fit=cover` plus `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
padding on the app wrapper, the auth page and the fixed overlays keeps an installed app clear of the notch and home
indicator. Neither can be seen in headless Chromium; they are checked on a phone.

Rules for mobile work:

- Layout goes in that stylesheet, keyed to upstream's structural classes (`mx_MatrixChat`, `mx_LeftPanel_panel`,
  `mx_RoomView`, `mx_RightPanel_ResizeWrapper`, `mx_Dialog`). Don't reach into component internals; when a rule
  needs a hook in a component, add one line there and keep the logic in a fork file.
- Interaction patterns follow Element X; sizes, type and colours are Compound tokens (`--cpd-*`), never literals.
- Verify by screenshot at a phone viewport against a scratch Synapse before and after, and check a desktop viewport
  too: the stylesheet must be a no-op above the breakpoint.

## Stale pages

A deploy replaces the build's files, and a page opened before it fails the next time it loads a chunk on demand: on
the register page that is the password strength check, so Register silently did nothing. `vector/stalePage.tsx`
turns the first `ChunkLoadError` into a dialog that says the page is out of date, offers Reload, and shows the
hard-refresh keys for the platform; the same error during start-up gets the same words on the error page. Keep the
guidance in step with the StartOS docs' hard-refresh instructions.

## Installable app

Upstream's `res/manifest.json`, touch icons and service worker already make the client installable; the fork only
lets a deployment name and brand it. `vector/webAppManifest.ts` merges `web_app_manifest` from the config over the
built-in manifest, serves the result from a blob URL in place of the static `manifest.json`, and points the
`apple-mobile-web-app-title` meta, favicon and touch icons at the same values, so iOS gets the branding whether or
not it reads the manifest. Without the key nothing runs and upstream's static files stand.

Rules for it:

- Keep `res/manifest.json` upstream's. Deployment branding is `web_app_manifest`; anything else the manifest should
  say for every deployment is an upstream change.
- Verify in Chromium through the DevTools protocol (`Page.getAppManifest` and `Page.getInstallabilityErrors` over a
  Playwright CDP session): headless Chromium never fires `beforeinstallprompt`, so that is the only signal that the
  served manifest passes the install checks.

## Push

`utils/push/webPush.ts` runs from `MatrixClientPeg.start` and keeps one HTTP pusher in step with Element's own
notification switch: when `web_push` is configured, notifications are enabled and permission is granted, it subscribes
through the service worker and registers the subscription with the homeserver in the form Sygnal's WebPush pushkin
expects (the p256dh key as the pushkey, `endpoint` and `auth` in `data`); when the switch goes off it removes both.
`serviceworker/push.ts` handles `push` and `notificationclick` in upstream's service worker and is written against
Sygnal's payload. Nothing runs without the config key.

Rules for it:

- The pusher asks Sygnal for `events_only` so a count-only push never reaches the browser: a push that shows no
  notification costs the site its permission on iOS after a few, and `only_last_per_room` so a burst collapses at
  the relay. Keep both.
- The worker shows nothing while a window of the app is visible, and tags notifications by room; the app's own
  notifications carry the same tag. Keep those two in step or the same message notifies twice.
- Types for the worker are hand-written in `push.ts`: the project's `lib` has no worker types and upstream's own
  worker file casts around that too. Don't add `webworker` to `tsconfig.json` for it.
- Headless Chromium cannot receive a push, so the worker is unit-tested on its exported functions and the whole path
  is proven on a phone against a deployment with Sygnal.

## Roadmap

1. Install prompt: an in-app "install" entry from `beforeinstallprompt` where the browser fires it, and a one-time
   Add to Home Screen hint on iOS Safari.
